    <h1>The Future of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare</h1>
    
    <div class="article">
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare by enabling more accurate diagnoses, 
            personalized treatments, and efficient healthcare delivery. Machine learning algorithms can now 
            analyze medical images with unprecedented precision, often outperforming human radiologists in 
            detecting early-stage cancers and other abnormalities.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            One of the most promising applications of AI in healthcare is in drug discovery. Traditional 
            pharmaceutical research can take decades and cost billions of dollars. AI-powered systems can 
            analyze vast databases of molecular structures, predict drug interactions, and identify potential 
            therapeutic compounds in a fraction of the time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Natural language processing (NLP) is transforming how healthcare providers 
            interact with electronic health records.</span> AI can extract relevant information from unstructured 
            medical notes, reducing administrative burden and allowing healthcare professionals to focus more 
            on patient care.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Predictive analytics powered by AI can identify patients at risk of developing chronic conditions 
            before symptoms appear. This enables preventive interventions that can significantly improve patient 
            outcomes while reducing healthcare costs. For example, AI models can predict which patients are 
            likely to be readmitted to the hospital, allowing for targeted discharge planning and follow-up care.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Despite these advances, the integration of AI in healthcare faces several challenges. Data privacy 
            and security concerns are paramount, as healthcare data is highly sensitive. Additionally, there are 
            concerns about algorithmic bias and the need for transparency in AI decision-making processes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The future of AI in healthcare looks promising, with continued innovations in areas such as robotic 
            surgery, virtual health assistants, and precision medicine. As these technologies mature, they will 
            likely become integral parts of healthcare delivery, improving outcomes for patients worldwide.

# Icon Placeholder Files

These files are placeholder SVG icons for the Chrome extension. In a production environment, you would replace these with properly designed PNG icons.

To generate proper icons:

1. Create a base 512x512 PNG icon
2. Use tools like https://icon.kitchen/ or https://realfavicongenerator.net/
3. Generate all required sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128

For now, these SVG placeholders will work for development.
